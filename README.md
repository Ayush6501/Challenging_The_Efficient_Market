## 1. Abstract...................................................................................................................................

This study challenges the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) by comparing the performance of
long-term investment strategies against two alternative approaches: mean reversion and
momentum-based tactical allocation. Simulations are conducted using real-world data to assess the
effectiveness of each strategy in achieving superior returns. The project utilizes two separate
studies:

Study 1: This study compares long-term investment with mean reversion for Intel stock prices
from 2018 to December 2023. The analysis is conducted in R and assesses the potential to
outperform the market by exploiting mean reversion tendencies in the stock price.

Study 2: This study compares long-term investment with momentum-based tactical allocation for
the top 10 stocks from the S&P 500, from 2018 to December 2023. Utilizing Python, the study
evaluates the effectiveness of capitalizing on momentum characteristics within the chosen stock
selection.

Through hypothesis testing, the project aims to determine if statistically significant differences exist
in the returns generated by each strategy compared to the long-term investment benchmark. This
research seeks to provide insights into the potential for outperforming the market through
alternative investment strategies.


## 2. Introduction

The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) postulates that stock prices reflect all available
information, making it impossible to consistently beat the market through fundamental analysis or
technical trading strategies. However, numerous investors and researchers have challenged this
hypothesis, suggesting that alternative approaches can generate superior returns.

This project investigates the validity of the EMH by comparing the performance of long-term
investment strategies with two alternative approaches: mean reversion and momentum-based
tactical allocation. Mean reversion refers to the tendency of prices to revert to their historical
average, while momentum investing seeks to capitalize on trends by buying stocks with strong
upward momentum and selling those with downward momentum.

Study 1: This study focuses on Intel stock prices, analyzing whether mean reversion strategies can
outperform the long-term buy-and-hold approach. Given Intel's historical price movements, the
study investigates the potential for identifying profitable trading opportunities based on mean
reversion tendencies.

Study 2: This study examines the top 10 S&P 500 stocks, comparing the performance of
momentum-based tactical allocation with long-term investment. By selecting stocks exhibiting
strong momentum characteristics, the study aims to assess the possibility of achieving higher
returns through tactical portfolio adjustments.

By conducting these two studies, this project aims to contribute to the ongoing debate surrounding
the EMH. Through simulations and hypothesis testing, the research seeks to provide empirical
evidence on the effectiveness of alternative investment strategies and their potential to generate
superior market returns.

investment strategies compared to the efficient market hypothesis.


## 4. Data Scraping and Setup

### 4.1 Study 1: Intel Stock Prices (R)

For Study 1, we employed the `getSymbols` function from the `quantmod` library in R to efficiently
retrieve historical Intel stock prices. This function possesses several advantages, including:

- Flexibility: It allows specifying the stock symbol, data source, and desired date range.
- Efficiency: It integrates with multiple data providers, enabling rapid data acquisition.
- Data format: It delivers data in a convenient format suitable for further analysis in R.

Here's an example code snippet demonstrating the usage of `getSymbols` to download Intel stock
prices:

This will download historical daily data for Intel stock, including open, high, low, close, and
volume values, within the specified date range.

Following is the structure of the data frame:


Following is the visualization of this data:


### 4.2 Study 2: S&P 500 Data (Python)........................................................................................

For Study 2, we employed the `get_data_yahoo` function from the `pandas_datareader.data`
library in Python to access historical S&P 500 constituent data. This function provides several
benefits:

- Comprehensiveness: It retrieves various data points beyond just prices, such as dividends and
    splits.
- Flexibility: It allows specifying individual stocks or a broad index like S&P 500.
- Data format: It delivers data in a pandas DataFrame format, readily accessible for further
    analysis.

Initially we used historical data to assess the top 1 1 stocks with the highest momentum:


For these stocks we used the `get_data_yahoo` to download the data from 2018 to 2023.

This will download daily data for the top 10 S&P 500 stocks, including open, high, low, close,
adjusted close, volume, dividends, and splits, within the specified date range.

Following is the visualization of this data:

By utilizing these efficient data scraping techniques in both R and Python, we were able to acquire
high-quality historical stock prices for both studies, enabling further analysis and simulation of
different investment strategies.


## 5. Investment Strategies

### 5.1 Mean reversion

Theoretical Foundation:

Mean reversion is a fundamental financial theory positing that asset prices, over time, tend to revert
back to their long-term mean or average. This notion is based on the belief that market forces
naturally correct over- and under-valuations, causing prices to gravitate towards their historical
average level. Essentially, the further an asset's price deviates from its mean, the higher the
probability of its future movement towards the mean.

Trading Signals:

To exploit this tendency, we employ statistical tools like Z-scores to quantify the deviation of an
asset's price from its long-term average. A Z-score represents the number of standard deviations an
asset's price is away from its mean. By analyzing the Z-score, we can identify potential trading
opportunities:

- Sell Signal: When the Z-score falls below -1, indicating the asset's price is significantly cheaper
    than its long-term average, we initiate a sell trade anticipating a future price increase towards
    the mean.
- Buy Signal: Conversely, when the Z-score rises above +1, signifying the asset's price is
    significantly higher than its long-term average, we trigger a buy trade expecting a future price
    decrease towards the mean.

Implementation Details:

In this simulation, we utilize the Z-score based trading signals outlined above. The specific
implementation involves:

- Calculating the Z-score: We utilize the historical price data of the target asset to calculate its
    mean and standard deviation. From these values, we compute the Z-score for each data point.
- Identifying Trading Signals: We compare each Z-score to the predefined thresholds of -1 and
    +1. If the Z-score falls below -1, a sell signal is generated, and if it rises above +1, a buy signal
    is activated.
- Executing Trades: Based on the generated signals, we execute buy and sell orders at specified
    time intervals, mimicking real-world trading activity.

Implementation in R:





### 5.2 momentum-based tactical allocation

Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA):

Tactical asset allocation is a dynamic strategy that involves actively adjusting portfolio holdings
across different asset classes based on current market conditions and future expectations. Unlike
static long-term allocation, TAA seeks to capitalize on market inefficiencies and short-term market
trends to potentially achieve higher returns.

Momentum Strategy:

Momentum trading is a strategy that focuses on identifying and exploiting trends in asset prices. It
emphasizes buying assets that are experiencing a sustained increase in price (positive momentum)
and selling those exhibiting a sustained decrease (negative momentum). The rationale lies in the
belief that strong trends tend to persist for a period of time, offering opportunities for profitable
trading.

Momentum Calculation:

To identify potential momentum opportunities, we utilize the following formula:

Momentum (Pi) = Pi / Pi-n

Where:

Pi: Price of a stock on day i

Pi-n: Price of the same stock n days ago

This formula calculates the relative price change over a specified period (n). A positive momentum
indicates an upward trend, while a negative momentum signifies a downward trend.

Portfolio Rebalancing:

Based on the calculated momentum values, we implement a dynamic portfolio rebalancing strategy:

Increase allocation: For assets with positive momentum exceeding a predefined threshold, we
increase their allocation within the portfolio, aiming to benefit from the potential continuation of
the upward trend.

Decrease allocation: Conversely, for assets with negative momentum exceeding a predefined
threshold, we decrease their allocation, minimizing potential losses from further price decline.


Implementation in Python

strategy, please refer the code file.


## 6. Hypothesis Testing

This section details the statistical tests utilized in the project to analyze and compare the
performance of different investment strategies.

### 6.1 Normality Test

Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test: We employed the Shapiro-Wilk test to assess whether the portfolio
returns were normally distributed. This test is crucial as many commonly used statistical analysis
methods rely on the assumption of normality. Understanding if our portfolio returns deviate from
normality allows us to choose appropriate analysis techniques and interpret the results accurately.

### 6.2 Hypothesis Testing

Mann-Whitney U Test: This non-parametric test was chosen to compare the returns of two
independent portfolios. It is used for ordinal or continuous data and makes no assumptions about
the underlying distributions, making it suitable for general comparisons.

Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test: This non-parametric test was employed to compare the returns of two
related portfolios, such as the long-term investment strategy and the alternative strategy under
investigation. It specifically focuses on the differences between paired samples and does not require
normality assumptions, making it robust and reliable for our specific use case.

### 6.3 Assumptions for Each Test

Mann-Whitney U Test

- Ordinal or Continuous Data: The data being compared must be at least ordinal or continuous
    in nature.
- Independent Groups: The two groups being compared must be independent, meaning no
    element belongs to both groups.
- Similar Distributions: Although not a strict requirement, the two groups are assumed to have
    similar distributions.
- Large Sample Size: A large enough sample size ensures the applicability of the central limit
    theorem.

Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

- Ordinal or Continuous Data: Similar to the Mann-Whitney U test, the data must be ordinal
    or continuous.
- Dependent Groups: This test is specifically designed for comparing two related or paired
    groups.
- Ordinal Differences: The differences between the paired samples must be ordinal or
    continuous.


- Non-Symmetric Differences: The distribution of the differences is assumed to be non-
    symmetric.

### 6.4 Justification for Choosing the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

Given the nature of our study, where we compare the performance of two related strategies (long-
term investment vs. alternative strategy), the **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test** is the most
appropriate choice. It satisfies all the assumptions for our data and provides a robust and reliable
method for testing whether the two strategies have statistically significant differences in returns.

## 7. Results and Conclusion

This project investigated the efficiency of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) by comparing
the performance of two alternative investment strategies: mean reversion and momentum-based
tactical allocation against a long-term investment benchmark. Based on the conducted simulations
and statistical analysis, the following findings were observed:

- Mean Reversion Strategy: The p-value obtained from the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test for the
    mean reversion study was less than the chosen significance level. This indicates a statistically
    significant difference in returns between the mean reversion and long-term investment
    strategies. This suggests that the mean reversion strategy was able to outperform the
    benchmark, potentially demonstrating the ability to generate profitable trading opportunities
    by capitalizing on price reversals.
- Momentum-Based Tactical Allocation Strategy: Similar to the mean reversion study, the p-
    value from the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test for the momentum-based tactical allocation study
    was also below the significance level. This implies a statistically significant difference in
    returns between the two strategies, suggesting that the momentum-based approach generated
    superior returns compared to the long-term investment benchmark. This further supports the
    potential profitability of exploiting momentum trends in the market.

Therefore, based on the results of both studies, the project provides evidence that challenges the
EMH. The statistically significant differences observed in returns between the alternative strategies
and the long-term investment benchmark indicate that it might be possible to consistently generate
profit through strategic investment approaches. These findings suggest that the efficient market
hypothesis may not hold true in all circumstances, and that active investment strategies may offer
opportunities for outperforming the market.


## 8. Presentation Question

1. Is the efficient market hypothesis applicable only to the stock market, or can it also be

```
applied to other forms of securities?
```
```
The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) is a theory that suggests that financial markets
are efficient and that investors have access to all available information to make informed
investment decisions. However, this theory has limitations and may not apply to all
markets. For example, markets that have limited liquidity or are influenced by emotions
may not behave efficiently.
```
```
To better understand the EMH's applicability, further research is needed to explore
market development, security types, and variations of the hypothesis. Such research can
help inform investment strategies across various financial landscapes. Evidence suggests
that some markets, such as bonds, exhibit efficient price discovery.
```
```
Overall, while EMH’s core principles hold promise, diverse market structures,
behavioral quirks, and transaction costs complicate its universal application. Therefore,
it is important to consider the context of each market and the limitations of the EMH
when applying it to other forms of securities.
